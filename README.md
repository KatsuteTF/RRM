# Random round modifier 

This plugin runs on SourceMod and is only for TF2.

This plugin will pick a random modifier(sub-plugin) and a random value for that modifier for each round. The possibilities are endless and every round will have a unique twist.

What are modifiers?
They modify/add certain effects on every player on server to make the round different and more fun. 

For example, one of the modifiers is called Random Head-shot explosion. The first round could make all head shots create an explosion. The second round could make melee damage increase to 350%. The third round could increase everyone speed to 150%. It's all random!

There can only be 1 active modifier per round. And will work for any map.
You can also write your own modifier!
